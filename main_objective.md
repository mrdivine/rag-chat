Main Objective:

To build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can answer questions based on the “Rehabilitation Guideline for the Management of Children with Cerebral Palsy” PDF, using LangChain and OpenAI’s GPT-4 API. The RAG system should consist of:

	1.	Extracting the text from the PDF.
	2.	Chunking the extracted text into manageable pieces.
	3.	Vectorizing these chunks for efficient retrieval.
	4.	Implementing a retrieval mechanism.
	5.	Generating responses using a language model.
	6.	Integrating the system into a simple API with monitoring and testing.

Open List of Things to Do:

	1.	Vectorization of Chunks:
	•	Implement the logic in vector_store.py to vectorize the text chunks using FAISS.
	•	Store the vectors in a vector store for retrieval.
	2.	Implement the Retriever:
	•	Use the vectorized chunks to implement a retriever in retriever.py.
	•	Ensure the retriever can pull relevant chunks for a given query based on cosine similarity or other distance metrics.
	3.	Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 API:
	•	Use the OpenAI GPT-4 API to generate responses using the retrieved chunks.
	•	Modify generator.py to interact with the API and incorporate the context provided by the retriever.
	4.	Testing of Each Component:
	•	Write unit tests for vector_store.py to ensure vectorization is accurate and efficient.
	•	Test retriever.py to verify that the most relevant chunks are retrieved for sample queries.
	•	Write integration tests to confirm that the RAG system works end-to-end.
	5.	API Enhancements and Integration:
	•	Extend main.py to integrate vectorization, retrieval, and generation into the API.
	•	Add endpoints for querying the RAG system and generating responses.
	•	Implement logging and monitoring to capture usage metrics and potential issues.
	6.	Monitoring and Testing in Production:
	•	Set up basic logging to monitor queries, retrieval results, and generated responses.
	•	Implement anomaly detection for inputs and outputs to identify outliers or retrieval failures.
	•	Deploy the system in a manner that allows for ongoing maintenance and updates.
	7.	Documentation and Cleanup:
	•	Document each part of the system, including how to run, test, and maintain the RAG system.
	•	Clean up the codebase, remove any unnecessary files, and ensure directory structures are optimized for production.

Optional Enhancements (Time Permitting):

	•	Implement more sophisticated chunking strategies based on content structure.
	•	Enhance the retriever using more advanced methods like dense passage retrieval (DPR).
	•	Improve response generation by adding fine-tuning or prompt engineering to tailor responses more precisely to user queries.
